Verify tools deps/lein dependency gpg signatures via allow-list

Uses https://github.com/liquidz/antq for much of file/artifact wrangling, but also
supports using environment based repo credentials from project.clj

## Usage

### Clojure Tools Deps

Add the following to your deps.edn:

```clojure

  :gpg-verify {:exec-fn org.kipz.gpg-verify.clojure/gpg-verify
               :exec-args {:verify [mycommany/internal-cljj]}
               :extra-deps {org.kipz/clj-gpg-verify {:mvn/version "0.1.2"}}}
```

### Leiningen

Put `[clj-gpg-verify "0.1.2"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your `:user`
profile or in the `:plugins` of your poject.clj:

Add a list of dependencies to verify to your project.clj:

```clojure
  :gpg-verify {:deps [mycommany/internal-clj]}
```

Then run:

```shell
$ lein gpg-verify
```
